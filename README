README phyloGenerator

A way to make phylogenies quickly and easily if you're an ecologist. Think of it as 'Phylomatic 2.0'.

EASY USE:
* Download a pre-packaged binary for whatever system you're on (Mac, Windows, Linux, ...)
* Mac: Open Terminal, run the file 'phyloGenerator.app/Contents/MacOS/phyloGenerator' - note that double clicking it will generate an error! For example, if I'd installed phyloGenerator into my home directory, I'd type '/Users/will/phyloGenerator.app/Contents/MacOS/phyloGenerator'.
* PC: TO-DO
* Linux: TO-DO
* Check the website for details of the command-line options - or just run the program and let it guide you through everything.

HARD USE (COMPILING IT):

Requires Python >=2.6; Biopython >=2.5; NumPy; SciPy.
For install instructions, just check out the webiste: http://willpearse.github.com/phyloGenerator/

Running it is simple; make sure phyloGenerator.py has permission to execute, then run it. If you use 'test.txt' for species to lookup, and 'test.fasta' as pre-made DNA to include, the whole thing should run through. It's far from perfect, so don't be surprised if you get error messages. I'm still working on it!

This is not a comprehensive readme! If you've got any questions, just ask me. Any feature requests, just pop them on the website.

Thanks for your time,
