A way to make phylogenies quickly and easily if you're an ecologist. Think of it as 'Phylomatic 2.0'.

REQUIRES: Python >=2.6; Biopython >=2.5; NumPy.

Very much a work-in-progress.
Eventually, you'll be able to just run it with 'python phyloGenerator' from the command line. You can at present, but you won't get a full workflow (i.e. it'll stop part-way through :p).
However, for the time being, it's a fairly handy set of functions you can use when manipulating DNA sequences in Python. There's no wiki yet, but there will be.
Email me if you want anything!

PS - If you've no idea what this is, probably best to just move along :p
