#DESCRIPTION
#'species.txt' - list of species
#'alignment.fasta' - COI alignment (after trimming, etc.)

#Simple search
/Applications/phyloGenerator.app/Contents/MacOS/phyloGenerator -name peruSimple -wd WHEREYOUWANTYOURFILES -email PUTINYOUROWNEMAIL -gene COI -species FILLINTHERESTOFTHISPATH/Demos/Peruvian_Vertebrates/species.txt -alignment mafft -phylogen beast-GTR-GAMMA
#This should look something like this, once you've filled in the bits I've put in capitals: /Applications/phyloGenerator.app/Contents/MacOS/phyloGenerator -name peruSimple -wd /Users/bob/phyloGenTest -email bob@university.ac.uk -gene COI -species /Users/bob/phyloGenTest/Demos/Peru_Vertebrates/species.txt -alignment mafft -phylogen beast-GTR-GAMMA
#This won't turn up sequences for everything, which is fine. So, when you get some sequences, enter 'replace' mode, and type 'THOROUGH'. phyloGenerator will search for replacement sequences for you.
#You will then need to 'merge' some congeners together ('Cebus'). Enter the 'merge' mode, and do so.
#You will also need to 'trim' any long sequences (I found one ~16000bp) phyloGenerator picks out for you. Just enter 'trim' mode, specify you're dealing with mitochondrial data, and away you go. If you don't do this, you may crash your computer!
#Check the alignments for warning messages, and compare them with 'metal'.
#You can't get sequences for all of these species. So just hit enter to continue, and phyloGenerator will ignore those species. Or, try searching again with more genes (see below).

#Simple search with RAxML, then using PATHd8 to smooth
/Applications/phyloGenerator.app/Contents/MacOS/phyloGenerator -name peruSimpleSmooth -wd WHEREYOUWANTYOURFILES -email PUTINYOUROWNEMAIL -gene COI -dna FILLINTHERESTOFTHISPATH/Demos/Peruvian_Vertebrates/sequences.fasta -alignment mafft -phylogen raxml-integratedBootstrap=500
#Note that I've already downloaded sequences here (from the previous phyloGenerator run), and so the process is much faster
#You can't specify that you will use PATHd8 from the commandline; note you have to specify an outgroup (a species that is equally distantly related to all other species). Here there's no sensible outgroup, but it demonstrates the approach.
#If you smooth with BEAST, note that you don't need to specify an outgroup.

#Searching with more genes

#Most times I run this, I find that a constraint tree is necessary to keep some of the clades monophyletic. Try outputting the taxonomy when you're at the constraint stage, and using that to generate a constraint tree, grouping members of the same family together, or just constraining mammals and birds together.
